# Practice

Seminar [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/fall19/week06_rnn/seminar_pytorch.ipynb)

This week's practice consists of two parts:
* basic character-level RNN for generating names `./seminar_*`
* the homework assignment on image captioning `./captioning_*`

As usual, feel free to pick any DL framework of your choosing.
