# Deep learning course

This repo supplements Deep Learning course taught at YSDA and HSE @fall'21. _For previous iteration visit the [spring21 branch](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/tree/spring21)._

Lecture and practice materials for each week are in ./week* folders. You can complete all asignments locally or in google colab (see readme files in week*)
