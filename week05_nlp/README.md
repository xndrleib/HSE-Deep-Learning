## Practice

Seminar: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/fall20/week05_nlp/seminar.ipynb)

Homework has two parts: the first is common for all frameworks, the second is framework-specific.
There are versions in pytorch, theano and tensorflow.

You can also find under `1d_conv_tasks` the following alternative assiments in theano:
* 1d convolutions for prohibited content filtering
* 1d convolutions for music processing
